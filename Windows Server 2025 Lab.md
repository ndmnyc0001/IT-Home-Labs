Windows Server 2025: Active Directory & RBAC Security Lab

## Optimized VM performance to run a modern 2025 server on legacy 2015 hardware

## Project Overview:
The goal of this lab was to simulate a real-world corporate IT environment by implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on a Windows Server 2025 instance. 
I successfully provisioned Active Directory objects, hardened file system security via NTFS permissions, and deployed a hidden network share to ensure data 
confidentiality.

## Tools Used:
Operating System: Windows Server 2025 (Standard Edition)

Hypervisor: VirtualBox (Running on a 2015 MacBook Pro)

Directory Services: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Network Protocol: SMB (Server Message Block) for hidden shares

## The Active Directory
In the GS_Accounting Properties, I implemented user1 as the type of name for the user group. To verify this object name by clicking on "Check Names", it shows
# User1: This is the specific Username assigned to the user.
# @: A seperator mostly used while sending email.
# NICOLENET.local: This is my Domain Name, the private network I built on the windows server.
